# GitTrainingStory

A nice story to learn about git

Once upon a time there was a magical land named Scottlogica.

Nothing seemed out of place except there were washing machines EVERYWHERE!

And they were full of sausage rolls.

The people were starving, but they couldn't eat the sausage rolls because the washing machines had a great union.

Great unrest was brewing under the surface, a conflict was about to get on a roll
